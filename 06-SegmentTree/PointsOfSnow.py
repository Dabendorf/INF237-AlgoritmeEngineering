""" We live in a one dimensional country and receive both weather reports telling about falling snow
	and queries how much snow there is at one place. Snow falls in the range [a,b) (badly described)
	Write a programme which stores these values and calculates the amount of snow at different places

	Solution:
	- Implementation of a segment tree with a range update and a point query
	- The query is the sum of the path of a node up to the trees root
	- The update goes to the leafs and works iteratively up to the parents depending if it is within the range or not
